# Data-Structures-Final-Project

This project actually consists of three completely different programs that each build off of their predecessors. Many concepts from one program were either slightly altered, simply moved, or removed altogether between each submission. To distinguish between each individual project, each program is stored within its own branch. For example, our first submission (including accompanying data) is stored under "Phase-1_Master".

This project was a collaboration between Anthony Grieco ("agrieco20"), Matthew O'Hara ("mwoh31"), and Zachary Phillips ("zaphillips").
